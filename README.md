# Mission_to_Mars

## Project Overview

This project is to scrape NASA's latest news, pictures, and basic information of Mars by using Python, load the data into the MongoDB, and build a template and display data in a local web page.

I also add Ajax at the end of the html template so it can load the web page after finishing the scraping but not seeing a blank page at first.
